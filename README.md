# iOS-Portfolio
This repository is an overview of what I have learned and worked on in IOS Development, 2018-2019.  
##All About Me
This was the first app I made in IOS Development. It is a simple app that uses some buttons to control the contents of a table view, showing the user a little about me, the app's creator.
##Pong Mobile
This was the first app that I made using SpriteKit, which is a high-level 2d graphics engine that is part of the Swift builtin library. It is not very graphically advanced, since it doesn't use any real art. The graphics are made using a few simple function calls. I still learned a lot by making this app, since I ended up reading a lot of the official documentation about SpriteKit made by Apple.
##SceneKit
After using SpriteKit for a while, I was inspired to check out the 3d equivalent: SceneKit. I never completed a full game using it, but I learned a lot by reading the official documentation. I ended up creating a 3d x-y-z axis using SceneKit as a frame of reference in the otherwise empty world. I also started working on a game where the player controls a block and has to dodge incoming projectiles, but I never fully finished it. Working with SceneKit was still a lot of fun, though.
